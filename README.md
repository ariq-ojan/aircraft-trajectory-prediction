# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Trajectory Prediction using K-Means & BiLSTM

## üìå Project Overview
This project proposes a **hybrid learning approach** using **trajectory clustering (K-Means)** and **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** to predict aircraft trajectories, aiming to enhance light predictability, reduce congestion and improve safety. As a **proof of concept**, it demonstrates the potential for acurately predicting other flight parameters.

## üöÄ **Key Highlights:**
- **150+ real flight trajectories** from Duluth (DLH) to Minneapolis (MSP) analyzed.
- **K-Means clustering** grouped similar flight and approach paths for improved accuracy.
- **BiLSTM model** accurately predicts future trajectory points until flight concludes.
- **Clustering improved accuracy by 15% (latitude) & 10.5% (longitude).**

## üìä Methods
1. **Data Collection:** Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) data from Boeing 747-300.
2. **Preprocessing:** Data cleansing, feature selection, resampling, normalization
3. **Clustering:** K-Means applied to segment trajectories.
4. **Deep Learning Model:** BiLSTM trained on clustered and unclustered flight paths. 
5. **Evaluation:** RMSE, MAE, and variance comparison.

## üìà Results
- Clustered BiLSTM outperforms unclustered models.  
- RMSE values indicate **high prediction accuracy**.  
- Potential applications in **air traffic management & automation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

### **‚ö†Ô∏èScope and Limitations**
1. Data used is strictly from a **747-300 flying from DLH to runway 30R and 12L of MSP airports**.
2. Clustering is done only based on **latitude and longitude**.
3. Deep learning model is limited to only considering the following features: **Time, latitude, longitude, altitude, groundspeed, and heading**.
4. Trajectories are analyzed purely in a **simplified 2D space**, focusing on path and trajectory, without considering flight dynamics or aerodynamic factors.


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection**
- 3000+ encrypted real flight data all across North America obtained from NASA's **Flight Data Monitoring (FDM)**
- 159 data of flights from Duluth (DLH) to Minneapolis (MSP) were selected
- Features used: **Time, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Speed, Heading**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing**
- **Data Cleansing:** Removing outliers & normalizing values.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting key parameters.  
- **Temporal Alignment:** Resampling for consistency across flights.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering (K-Means)**
- Used **Elbow Method** to determine optimal clusters.  
- Segmented trajectories to enhance model training.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning Model (BiLSTM)**
- **Why BiLSTM?** Captures both past & future dependencies in time-series data.  
- **Architecture:**  
  - Input: Latitude, Longitude, Speed, Time  
  - Hidden Layers: 2 BiLSTM layers + Dropout  
  - Output: Predicted flight position  
- **Training:** RMSE & MAE used for loss function.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics**
| Model  | RMSE (Latitude) | RMSE (Longitude) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| No Clustering | 0.032 | 0.045 |
| K-Means + BiLSTM | **0.027** (‚¨áÔ∏è15%) | **0.040** (‚¨áÔ∏è10.5%) |
